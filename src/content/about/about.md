# Alex Grønmark builds systems that make eCommerce smarter, faster, and more profitable.

I exist in that _sweet spot_ between conversion psychology and code…

For 8+ years, <mark>I’ve helped eComm & B2B brands pivot for profit</mark>: from managing lean CRO programs, to leading UX, to building entire storefronts from the ground up, and even designing content structure for growth.

<!-- (Oh, and confusingly I also write about art) -->

Now I’m focused on the next step: using AI and modern workflows to automate experimentation, and make optimisation feel like engineering.
